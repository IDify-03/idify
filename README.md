# Data Verification Platform

## Overview

The Data Verification Platform is a blockchain-based solution designed to securely manage data verification processes for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and organizations, such as banks. The platform utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance data privacy and security while allowing organizations to verify specific data without exposing sensitive information.

- **Navigation Bar**: Provides easy access to key sections including wallet address, organisation, notifications, and data management.
- **Get Started**: Authentication using MetaMask or other secure methods.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: Allows SMEs to generate ZKPs to prove data possession without revealing the data.
